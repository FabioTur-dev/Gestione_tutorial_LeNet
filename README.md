# Gestione_tutorial_LeNet
The project should implement a simple neural network (similar to LeNet) on the MNIST dataset, use the GPU when available, and follow good software engineering practices: a clean repository structure, configuration files (e.g. YAML), fixed random seeds for reproducibility, and separate scripts for training and evaluation.
